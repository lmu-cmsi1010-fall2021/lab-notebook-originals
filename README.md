**CMSI 1010** Computer Programming & Laboratory, Fall 2021

# Lab Notebook Original Files

Hi! This repository stores ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù versions of our course‚Äôs lab notebooks. There‚Äôs a learning curve for working with them and creating your own copies; the following instructions seek to get you acquainted with this workflow.

## Preparation
[Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/) (or just Google Colab for short) is our course‚Äôs chosen mechanism for running Python [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Notebooks provide a way to learn about and interact with Python code, without worrying about the operational details involved with computer programming. (you‚Äôll get enough of those in the other assignments!)

In order to work with the notebooks that we will share with you, you will need the following:
1. A Google account to follow these instructions successfully (you don‚Äôt need to tell us what it is‚Äîyour Google Drive will serve as your workspace)
2. A GitHub account
3. Your _1010-lab-notebooks_ repository for the course‚Äîclick on this link to set it up: https://classroom.github.com/a/7ZTMixoE

**Important:** Make sure to deactivate popup windows for collab.research.google.com‚Äîit needs those to occasionally ask your permission to access GitHub

## Workflow

### Overview
The notebooks that we provide are ‚Äúfinal copies‚Äù that can‚Äôt be modified‚Äîthat way you can get back to them fresh at any time.
* To make changes to them, you will make a copy of the notebook in Google Drive
* To submit your notebook, place a copy of your worked-on notebook in the _1010-lab-notebooks_ repository on GitHub
* You may copy your notebook to GitHub as frequently as you like

### Details
1. Click on our shared notebook link to open it in Colab
2. From the Colab menu, choose _File > Save a copy in Drive_ to create your own _private copy_ of the notebook
3. Work on your copy of the notebook as needed
4. When you are ready to submit the notebook, first choose _Edit > Clear all outputs_ to reset all of the notebook‚Äôs code blocks
5. Choose _File > Save a copy in GitHub_ to create your _submitted copy_ of the notebook
6. Make sure to set your _1010-lab-notebooks_ Repository as the destination of the file to save
7. Choose `main` as the Branch into which to save
8. Provide a _Commit message_‚Äîdescribe what‚Äôs different in your version of the notebook

You may repeat the last four steps as frequently as needed in case you want to revise your GitHub copy. Do your work on the _Google Drive copy_ but submit as needed to GitHub.

Every time you save a copy to GitHub, you will add a _commit_ to that file. This way, you can follow how the content of your notebook evolves over time, accompanied by your own description of what you changed.

Here‚Äôs an example:

When running our notebooks, Colab may warn you that the code isn‚Äôt safe:

For _the notebooks that we share with you_, go ahead and click on _Run anyway_. We won‚Äôt share any harmful notebooks with you ü§ó

For all other notebooks that you might try from the Internet, it‚Äôs a good habit to verify that the source/author of the notebook can be relied upon. And that‚Äôs why Colab checks with you first!

## The Notebooks!
Click on these links to open them in Colab. Remember, you can‚Äôt modify these original versions. Instead, follow the workflow listed above to create a copy for yourself on Google Drive. When you‚Äôre ready to submit it, choose _Edit > Clear all outputs_ from the Colab menu then choose _File > Save a copy in GitHub_ to submit it to GitHub.

> You can actually synthesize these links manually in case you don‚Äôt have access to this page‚Äîsee the ‚ÄúLoading Public Notebooks Directly from GitHub‚Äù section in [Using Google Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) for those instructions.
